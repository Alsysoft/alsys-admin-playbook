With the help of this feature, admins can track working hours for each user and generate reports which can be exported as pdf and csv or sent to email.

### <font color="gray">Filters</font>

Filters are used for generating Time & Attendance custom reports. In the top section of the T&A there are multiple filter settings for setting and saving in the filters' gallery:
* In the "User group" dropdown choose grouped users based on criteria.
* In the "Device / Location" dropdown choose from all the locations available in the organization.
* In the "User" dropdown choose certain users from the "User Group" or all users from the same user group.

### <font color="gray">Generate Report and Export</font>

* A report is generated based on the Time & Attendance information filtered.
* It contains the name of the user, the company/group he is part of, the trade and device, date, clock in and out time and total number of worked hours.
* Generate data based on a time frame by selecting the date-picker in the top right input.
* After the filters are set, the data will be exported by tapping on the “Export” button.
