### <font color="gray">Newsfeed post categories: Toolbox Talks, RAMS, Training</font>

Newsfeed posts are distributed, depending on their content, in these three categories which can be found on the Home screen in the User Application. 
The structure of the posts is the same <!-- at the moment -->, the only difference being the content, based on what files and information admins attach to the posts.

### <font color="gray">How to confirm a post?</font>

Post confirmation requires reading and understanding all the files attached. The most important file attached is the one displayed under the title and has the “Open document” button on it.
- After reviewing all the post's attachments, the “Confirm” button will become active.
- If the admin set a questionnaire for the post, it will be displayed after tapping on the “Confirm” button. The user must answer all the questions correctly to confirm the post.

import newsf2 from '/Users/tehciaktm/Documents/GitHub/alsys_admin_cards/static/img/newsf2.png';

After submitting the post, it will be displayed in the Confirmed section:
