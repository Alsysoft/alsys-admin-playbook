### <font color="gray">Health section as part of the Onboarding</font>

New users that accept a compay's invitation will go through the mandatory onboarding process (Induction and Health).

Regarding the health part of the onboarding process, the new users will have to respond to a questionnaire previously set up by the company's administrator (there aren't any correct or incorrect answers). The users' answers will be saved and displayed in the User Details screen in the Admin Application for later review.

<img src={healthsts} alt="healthsts" width="700"/>

### <font color="gray">Health section in Home screen</font>

When an update <!-- of the health questionnare --> is being made, the user is notified and on the Home screen is displayed a notification badge, which will disappear when the user will complete the updated Health Section.

import healthhome from '/Users/tehciaktm/Documents/GitHub/alsys_admin_cards/static/img/healthhome.png'

<img src={healthhome} alt="healthhome" width="500"/>
